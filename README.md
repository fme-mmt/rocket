##Problem description

###Title
Equilibrium for combustion of rocket propellant

###Description
Rocket engines work by means of an exothermic reaction mixture of gases at high temperature. In this condition the components dissociate making the problem of finding the parameters of the reaction harder.
The goal would be to provide an full open-source solver for combustion problems involving a gas mixture with dissociation.

###Precise tasks

- Review the concepts and laws behind the problem: Enthalpy, Dissociation   Partial pressure, Molar fraction, Gibbs-Dalton’s law, internal energy,
- equilibrium, Entropy, Gibbs’ free energy.
- State a optimization problem for the Gibbs’ energy.
- Come up with a open-source (Python-based) numeric solving procedure for the problem.
- Compare it to the existing MATLAB (HGS Chemical Equation Solver) solution.
- Propose and explore improvements (speed, complexity, easy of use)
- Document the solution and upload it into a public repository.
